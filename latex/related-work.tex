%% Proof assistants like Coq or Isabelle have demonstrated effectiveness
%% for conducting mathematical proofs or programs verification.
%% %
%% Successful applications include the verified C compiler
%% CompCert\cite{compcert}, the demonstration of the four coulour
%% theorem\cite{gonthier2007four}, or seL4\cite{klein2009sel4}, a
%% verified operating system kernel.

%% More recently, the \gls{fstar} language shined with the Project
%% Everest\cite{project-everest}, which delivered a series of formally
%% verified, high-performance, cryptography libraries:
%% %
%% HACL*\cite{haclstar}, ValeCrypt\cite{bond2017vale} and
%% EverCrypt\cite{protzenko2020evercrypt}; that are for instance used and
%% deployed in Mozilla Firefox.
%% %
%% \gls{fstar} is a dependently typed language that offers proof assitant
%% features.
%% %
%% It heavily relies on refinement types and weakest-preconditions, and
%% at its hearts leverages the SMT solver Z3\cite{z3}.
%% %
%% \gls{fstar}'s SMT nature makes proof automatic by default.


%% Most static analysers based on abstract interpretation have not been
%% themselves verified: thus, their analysis are always sound up to their
%% possible implementation bugs.
%% %
%% Efforts in verified abstract interpretation are
%% numerous\cite{Pich:these,ITP10:Cachera:Pichardie,SAS13:Blazy:al,Nipkow-ITP12},
%% and go up to Verasco\cite{POPL15:Jourdan:al}, a modular, real-world
%% abstract interpreter verified in Coq.
%% %
%% \cite{SAS13:Blazy:al} and Verasco\cite{POPL15:Jourdan:al} follow
%% closely the modular design of Astrée; we exhibit a similar modularity
%% on a smaller scale.

%% So far, verified abstract interpreters have been focused on
%% concretization-based formalizations. The work of Darais et al.
%% \cite{darais-oopsla15} is the only one to really consider the use of
%% galois connections.
%% %
%% They rely on the Agda proof assitant.
%% %
%% They provide a minimalist abstract inteprrter for imperative language
%% but this interpreter seems very limited compared to ours. ==> Agda
%% c'est un peu comme Coq.

%% However, such analysers require a non-trivial amount of mechanized
%% proof.
%% %
%% By constract, this paper shows that it is possible to implement a
%% formally verified abstract interpreter with very little manual proof.
